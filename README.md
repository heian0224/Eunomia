# Introduction
Eunomia is a distributed application framework that facilitates developers to quickly develop distributed applications and supports distributed protocols on the market, such as Gossip protocol, QuorumNWR algorithm, PBFT algorithm, PoW algorithm, and ZAB protocol.
It is named Eunomia because the most important thing in a distributed world is order and rules, so the name of the goddess of law and legislation in Greek mythology is used.
